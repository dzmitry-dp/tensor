## Technical task

Need a tool that will help navigate in text notes.

__TestMessages - in this case, a set of text files that are designed in Markdown style and mimic a "note box"__

# How it can be used

### Virtual environment
	python -m venv venv_name

Activate virtual enviroment on Windows:

    .\venv_name\Scripts\activate
Activate virtual enviroment on Linux:

	source venv_name/bin/activate

### Upgrade pip and install all modules
    pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

### Start the Script
    python -i /адрес_до/файла/map.py
